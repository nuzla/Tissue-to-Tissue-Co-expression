# Tissue-to-Tissue-Co-expression
The study of gene expression patterns across multiple tissues to find genes that show comparable expression profiles in various tissues is known as tissue-to-tissue co-expression. This kind of analysis is frequently employed in genome research to investigate gene networks, regulatory processes, and functional correlations.
